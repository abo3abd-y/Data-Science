    "The following would be some **examples of cheating** when working on HW assignments in CSCI 3022.  Any of these constitute a **violation of the course's collaboration policy and will result in an F in the course and a trip to the honor council**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Consulting web pages that may have a solution to a given homework problem or one similar is cheating.  However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",
    " - Copying a segment of code or math solution of three lines or more from another student from a printout, handwritten copy, or by looking at their computer screen \n",
    " - Allowing another student to copy a segment of your code or math solution of three lines or more\n",
    " - Taking a copy of another student's work (or a solution found online) and then editing that copy\n",
    " - Reading someone else’s solution to a problem on the HW before writing your own.\n",
    " - Asking someone to write all or part of a program or solution for you.\n",
    " - Asking someone else for the code necessary to fix the error for you, other than for simple syntactical errors\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the following are some **examples of things which would NOT usually be\n",
    "considered to be cheating**:\n",
    " - Working on a HW problem on your own first and then discussing with a classmate a particular part in the problem solution where you are stuck.  After clarifying any questions you should then continue to write your solution independently.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how a particular construct in the language works.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how to formulate a particular construct in the language.\n",
    " - Asking someone for help in finding an error in your program.  \n",
    " - Asking someone why a particular construct does not work as you expected in a given program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether you are truly doing your own work and retaining what you've learned you should be able to easily reproduce from scratch and explain a HW solution that was your own when asked in office hours by a TA/Instructor or on a quiz/exam.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have difficulty in formulating the general solution to a problem on your own, or\n",
    "you have difficulty in translating that general solution into a program, it is advisable to see\n",

    "Write code in the space below that completes the following steps:\n",

    "Step 1:  Write a function to simulate 10,000 random draws from `cards` of 5 cards each, and check if each draw is Three of a Kind. The function should return the overall proportion of random hands (out of the 10,000) in which Three of a Kind was observed. If you have coded your simulation correctly, your answer to this part should be very close to your theoretical answer from Part 4A.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2:  Let's visualize how this simulation converges to the theoretical probability.   In class, we plotted a running estimate of the probability of an event as a function of the number of trials in our simulation.  Write code that completes 10,000 random draws of 5 cards each, but this time outputs a plot of a running estimate of the proportion of hands that are Three of a Kind as a function of the number of trials (from 1 to 10,000) in your simulation.  **Include a red horizontal line on your plot with the theoretical probability that you calculated in part 4A.**  Be sure to include a title on your plot and be sure to label both your axes on the plot.\n",

    "To play a game, you have a bag containing 28 fair [four-sided dice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-sided_die), with faces `{1,2,3,4}`.  This bag also contains 9 fair six-sided dice (faces `{1,2,3,4,5,6}`) and 3 fair twenty-sided dice (faces `{1,2,3,4,...,19,20}`).  Call these 3 classes of die \"Four\", \"Six\" and \"Twenty\" (or $D_4$, $D_6$, and $D_{20}$, for short).  You grab one die at random from the box.  \n",

    "However, since the four-sided dice does not have a 5, then the probability for that becomes zero. Now, for the other two probabilities, we can use conditional probability to simplify this expression: $$P(R_5) = P(R_5 | D_6) \\cdot P(D_6) + P(R_5 | D_{20}) \\cdot P(D_{20})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, calculating $P(R_5 | D_6)$ is pretty straightforward since it becomes $1/6$. For $P(D_6)$, it is also straightforward because all you need to do is add the number of dices together and the number of six-sided dices and divide it by the total number of dices. Thus, $P(D_6) = 9/40$. Same for the other expression, $P(R_5 | D_{20})$ becomes $1/20$ and $P(D_{20})$ becomes $3/20$. Therefore:\n",
