    "Data science is a collaborative activity.  However a key step in learning and retention is **creating solutions on your own.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are examples of acceptable vs unacceptable use of resources and collaboration when doing HW assignments in CSCI 3022.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following would be some **examples of cheating** when working on HW assignments in CSCI 3022.  Any of these constitute a **violation of the course's collaboration policy and will result in an F in the course and a trip to the honor council**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Consulting web pages that may have a solution to a given homework problem or one similar is cheating.  However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",
    " - Copying a segment of code or math solution of three lines or more from another student from a printout, handwritten copy, or by looking at their computer screen \n",
    " - Allowing another student to copy a segment of your code or math solution of three lines or more\n",
    " - Taking a copy of another student's work (or a solution found online) and then editing that copy\n",
    " - Reading someone else’s solution to a problem on the HW before writing your own.\n",
    " - Asking someone to write all or part of a program or solution for you.\n",
    " - Asking someone else for the code necessary to fix the error for you, other than for simple syntactical errors\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the following are some **examples of things which would NOT usually be\n",
    "considered to be cheating**:\n",
    " - Working on a HW problem on your own first and then discussing with a classmate a particular part in the problem solution where you are stuck.  After clarifying any questions you should then continue to write your solution independently.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how a particular construct in the language works.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how to formulate a particular construct in the language.\n",
    " - Asking someone for help in finding an error in your program.  \n",
    " - Asking someone why a particular construct does not work as you expected in a given program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether you are truly doing your own work and retaining what you've learned you should be able to easily reproduce from scratch and explain a HW solution that was your own when asked in office hours by a TA/Instructor or on a quiz/exam.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have difficulty in formulating the general solution to a problem on your own, or\n",
    "you have difficulty in translating that general solution into a program, it is advisable to see\n",
    "your instructor or teaching assistant rather than another student as this situation can easily\n",
    "lead to a, possibly inadvertent, cheating situation.\n",

    "You are waiting in line at the grocery store. It is taking _forever_!  There are only two lines open; one is being tended by a cashier named [John Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_(folklore)), and the other is tended by a [self check-out machine](https://theconversation.com/the-economics-of-self-service-checkouts-78593). Like all human beings when they arrive at the front of the store to check-out and encounter lines everywhere, you first experience a moment of intense panic. _Which line will be the fastest?_ you wonder, as people shuffle around you.\n",
    "\n",
    "You decide you need to model the arrival of customers at the front of each of the lines.  If you haven't already, read the [required textbook reading on the Poisson Distribution].(https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientists/en/part2/poisson/)  \n",
    "\n",
    "From your Intro to Data Science class you remember that the distribution of independent random arrivals is often modeled using a Poisson distribution.  You observe the following:\n",
    "* John's line checks-out an average of 4 customers per ten minutes,\n",
    "* the self check-out machine checks-out an average of 5 customers per ten minutes **if** the machine is working properly, \n",
    "* the self check-out machine checks-out an average of 1 customer per ten minutes if the machine is freezing up, and\n",
    "* in any given moment, the self check-out machine has a probability of 0.1 of freezing up.\n",

    "In Questions 4e and 4f above it was possible to calculate the probabilities exactly.  However, in some situations it may be too challenging to calculate an exact theoretical probability in which case we can use numerical simulation to estimate the probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part we're going to re-do Questions 4e and 4f via simulation to demonstrate that we're able to get very close to the theoretical probabilities via simulation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "That is, we're going to simulate the distribution of the number of customers John serves in his 5 hour shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "i).  Use the `np.random.poisson` function to randomly sample 100,000 times (with replacement) from a Poisson distribution with the same parameter $\\lambda$ you used in Question 4e.   Save these simulated values in a `numpy array` called `random_sample`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ii). Then plot a **density histogram** of your simulated values.  Your histogram should look very similar to the theoretical histogram you plotted in Question 4e.  \n",
    "Set the bin parameter to be `bins = np.arange(80,160)`.\n",
    "Be sure to include a title and labels for the units of your x and y axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "iii).  Then use your simulated values to calculate the (simulated) probability that John serves 100 or more customers in a 5-hour block. Your answer should be very close to the theoretical answer you calculated in part 4f.\n"
