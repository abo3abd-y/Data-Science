    "The following would be some **examples of cheating** when working on HW assignments in CSCI 3022.  Any of these constitute a **violation of the course's collaboration policy and will result in an F in the course and a trip to the honor council**.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - Consulting web pages that may have a solution to a given homework problem or one similar is cheating.  However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",
    " - Copying a segment of code or math solution of three lines or more from another student from a printout, handwritten copy, or by looking at their computer screen \n",
    " - Allowing another student to copy a segment of your code or math solution of three lines or more\n",
    " - Taking a copy of another student's work (or a solution found online) and then editing that copy\n",
    " - Reading someone else’s solution to a problem on the HW before writing your own.\n",
    " - Asking someone to write all or part of a program or solution for you.\n",
    " - Asking someone else for the code necessary to fix the error for you, other than for simple syntactical errors\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the following are some **examples of things which would NOT usually be\n",
    "considered to be cheating**:\n",
    " - Working on a HW problem on your own first and then discussing with a classmate a particular part in the problem solution where you are stuck.  After clarifying any questions you should then continue to write your solution independently.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how a particular construct in the language works.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how to formulate a particular construct in the language.\n",
    " - Asking someone for help in finding an error in your program.  \n",
    " - Asking someone why a particular construct does not work as you expected in a given program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether you are truly doing your own work and retaining what you've learned you should be able to easily reproduce from scratch and explain a HW solution that was your own when asked in office hours by a TA/Instructor or on a quiz/exam.   \n",

    "If you have difficulty in formulating the general solution to a problem on your own, or\n",

    "\n",
    "Polls usually start with a \"horse-race\" question, where respondents are asked whom they would vote for in a head-to-head race if the election were tomorrow: Candidate A or Candidate B. The survey begins with this question so that the respondent is not influenced by any of the other questions asked in the survey. Some of these other questions are asked to help assess how likely is it that the respondent will vote. Other questions are asked about age, education, and sex in order to adjust the findings if one group appears overly represented in the sample.\n",

    "i).  Make a **frequency** histogram of `simulations`.   This is a histogram of the sampling distribution of Trump's proportion advantage in Pennsylvania. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: You should use the [`plt.hist`](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html) function in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to include a title as well as axis labels. You can do this using `plt.title`, `plt.xlabel`, and `plt.ylabel`.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii).  Based on your simulation, what is the probability that a random sample of 1500 will correctly predict that Trump wins Pennsylvania? (i.e. what proportion of these simulations predict a Trump victory?)  Assign your answer to `prob_penn_1500_random_correct`\n"
