However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",

    "### 1.1 Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "One way that scientists can misuse the p-value is that they would stimulate their data under different statistic each time until they find something with the right p-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way that is it is commonly misused is that the p-value is sometimes used for indicating the probability of a result occurring by chance when the p-value is used for indicating the probability of observing the results given a particular hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, p-value is also used as a substitute for scientific reasoning and a way to replace it which might lead researchers to prioritize obtaining p-values below an arbitrary threshold (such as 0.05) rather than focusing on scientific merit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the article, p-value must be used as a tool to embrace uncertainty and variation rather than replacing the p-value with an alternative statistical measure. Another suggestion from other experts mention that the p-value can be replaced with other statistical measures such confidence intervals or Bayesian analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "14 tests. This is because if you do 14 tests and you had a $95$% of the time where none of the tests come up significant, then you will have at least one test where there are more than $50$% likely that at least one of the tests will incorrectly reject the null hypothesis. Thus is because of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$1 - (0.95)^x > 0.5$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is the minimum number of tests needed to get more than $50$% that least one test that will incorrectly reject the null hypothesis. When we solve for $x$, we get $x > 13.5134$ or when rounded to the nearest integer, we get $x \\ge 14$ or $14$ tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.4 Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bonferroni correction is used so that even if you do multiple tests, the probability that at least one test will incorrectly reject the null hypothesis will still stay at $5$% more or less. To do this, the p-value must be adjusted such that if you are doing $x$ tests and you have an initial p-value of $0.05$, then your new p-value is $0.05/x$ so that the probability of that at least one test will incorrectly reject the null hypothesis stays at $5$% more or less. For example, if we wanted to test the effect of 5 different health measures on the risk of stroke, we would need a p value of $0.05/5 = 0.01$ so that the probability of correctly rejecting the null is $0.99$ and this work only if you do the test 5 times. The cutoff will change if you change the number of tests you are doing. So, with 5 tests, your cutoff is $1$% and the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null stays at $5$%."

However, if we suspect that the die might be unfair based on the data, we can conduct a hypothesis test using TVD to compare the expected [$\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$, $\\frac{1}{6}$] distribution to what is actually observed.\n",

    "## Question 4: Deflategate\n",
    "\n",
    "On January 18, 2015, the Indianapolis Colts and the New England Patriots played the American Football Conference (AFC) championship game to determine which of those teams would play in the Super Bowl. After the game, there were allegations that the Patriots' footballs had not been inflated as much as the regulations required; they were softer. This could be an advantage, as softer balls might be easier to catch.\n",
    "\n",
    "For several weeks, the world of American football was consumed by accusations, denials, theories, and suspicions: the press labeled the topic Deflategate, after the Watergate political scandal of the 1970's. The National Football League (NFL) commissioned an independent analysis. In this example, we will perform our own analysis of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pressure is often measured in pounds per square inch (psi). NFL rules stipulate that game balls must be inflated to have pressures in the range 12.5 psi and 13.5 psi. Each team plays with 12 balls. Teams have the responsibility of maintaining the pressure in their own footballs, but game officials inspect the balls. Before the start of the AFC game, all the Patriots' balls were at about 12.5 psi. Most of the Colts' balls were at about 13.0 psi. However, these pre-game data were not recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the second quarter, the Colts intercepted a Patriots ball. On the sidelines, they measured the pressure of the ball and determined that it was below the 12.5 psi threshold. Promptly, they informed officials. \n",
    "\n",
    "At half-time, all the game balls were collected for inspection. Two officials, Clete Blakeman and Dyrol Prioleau, measured the pressure in each of the balls. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the data. Each row corresponds to one football. Pressure is measured in psi. The Patriots ball that had been intercepted by the Colts was not inspected at half-time. Nor were most of the Colts' balls – the officials simply ran out of time and had to relinquish the balls for the start of second half play."

    "“The average pressure drop of the Patriots game balls exceeded the average pressure drop of the Colts balls by 0.45 to 1.02 psi, depending on various possible assumptions regarding the gauges used, and assuming an initial pressure of 12.5 psi for the Patriots balls and 13.0 for the Colts balls.”  (Investigative report commissioned by the NFL regarding the AFC Championship game on January 18, 2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analysis shows an average pressure drop of about 0.73 psi, which is close to the center of the interval “0.45 to 1.02 psi” and therefore consistent with the official analysis.\n",

    "But the all-important question in the football world was about causation: the question was whether the excess drop of pressure in the Patriots’ footballs was deliberate. If you are curious about the answer given by the investigators, here is the full report:\n",
