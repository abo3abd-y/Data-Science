    " - Consulting web pages that may have a solution to a given homework problem or one similar is cheating.  However, consulting the class notes, and web pages that explain the material taught in class but do NOT show a solution to the homework problem in question are permissible to view.  Clearly, there's a fuzzy line here between a valid use of resources and cheating. To avoid this line, one should merely consult the course notes, the course textbook, and references that contain syntax and/or formulas.\n",
    " - Copying a segment of code or math solution of three lines or more from another student from a printout, handwritten copy, or by looking at their computer screen \n",
    " - Allowing another student to copy a segment of your code or math solution of three lines or more\n",

    "On the other hand, the following are some **examples of things which would NOT usually be\n",

    " - Working on a HW problem on your own first and then discussing with a classmate a particular part in the problem solution where you are stuck.  After clarifying any questions you should then continue to write your solution independently.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how a particular construct in the language works.\n",
    " - Asking someone (or searching online) how to formulate a particular construct in the language.\n",
    " - Asking someone for help in finding an error in your program.  \n",
    " - Asking someone why a particular construct does not work as you expected in a given program.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "To test whether you are truly doing your own work and retaining what you've learned you should be able to easily reproduce from scratch and explain a HW solution that was your own when asked in office hours by a TA/Instructor or on a quiz/exam.   \n",

    "## Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "a) The Central Limit Theorem applies here because proportions is basically a sum but for each sum, we are dividing it by the size of the sample which is perfectly valid and will still gives us the Central Limit Theorem as long as it still involves a sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) First, we need to understand that the standard deviation is basically the square root of the variance. Variance is basically the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma^2 = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we need to find the expected value first and then $E[X^2]$ to find the variance (before we continue, here we are assuming that $p$ is the proportion of ones and therefore $1 - p$ is the propotion of zeros):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X] = 1 \\cdot p + 0 \\cdot (1 - p) = p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[X^2] = 1^2 \\cdot p + 0^2 \\cdot (1 - p) = p$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma^2 = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 = p - p^2 = p (1 - p)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we calculated the variance, we can calculate the standard deviation by square rooting the variance that we calculated:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma = \\sqrt{p (1 - p)}$$\n",

    "In the following few questions we're going to walk through the steps to calculate our confidence interval using the Central Limit Theorem (and then we'll compare to the bootstrapped confidence interval we found in 4.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using only the Central Limit Theorem and the numbers of Yes and No voters in our sample of 400, *algebraically* compute the predicted standard deviation of the `resample_yes_proportions` array. Assign this number to `approximate_sd`. **Do not access the data in `resample_yes_proportions` in any way.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the standard deviation of the sample means can be computed from the population SD and the size of the sample (the formula above might be helpful). If we do not know the population SD, we can use the sample SD as a reasonable approximation in its place.
